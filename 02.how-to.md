This is very simple way of compiling JerryScript. (Please add more so to guide how to build.)

## Get the source

You may know this.
```
git clone https://github.com/Samsung/jerryscript.git
cd jerryscript
```

## Building

It's based on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS. You may need to read https://github.com/Samsung/jerryscript/wiki/Prerequisites before starting.

```
make
```
For the first time of the make, it'll prepare prerequisites with next message. It may take some time so go grab some coffee.
```
Setting up prerequisites... (log file: ./build/prerequisites/prerequisites.log)
```

After prerequisites are prepared, make will build all supporting platforms and mods. It may also take a while.

If only debug version for linux for development, just do as;
```
make debug.linux
```

without LTO(Link Time Optimization) and debug for linux
```
LTO=ff make debug.linux
```

if something goes wrong, it'll show
```
Build failed. See ./build/bin/unittests/make.log for details.
```

## Testing
```
make unittests
```
It should have no errors if it is ok.

## Check before committing
```
make precommit -j
```
This will check any problems in your modifications. may take some time depending on your machine. This is necessary before pull requests but can omit for local commits.
